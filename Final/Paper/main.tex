\section{Introduction}
\subsection{What is this paper about?}
We have a large variety of things to show, including blindtext and nice visuals such as tables and graphs.

\section{Materials and Methods}
In this section we would hypothetically introduce the materials and the methods that we used to conduct our hypothetical research

\section{Results}

\subsection{Simple table}
Here we introduce a simpler table, where we don't use the dcolumn package. So this table is what a standard LaTeX table could look like.
\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|l|c c r|}
    \hline
    \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{4 joined cells}\\
    \hline
    $\alpha$ & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
    $\beta$ & 4 & 5 & 6 \\
    $\gamma$ & 7 & 8 & 9 \\
    $\delta$ & $0$ & $+$ & $-$\\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
  \caption{A simple table with some numbers, some greek letters and some signs}
\end{table}

\subsection{Cool table with dcolumn}
What follows is a table with all decimals vertically aligned. This is achieved using the \href{https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn}{dcolumn package}.\footnotemark[1]
\begin{table}[ht]
\newcolumntype{a}{D{.}{.}{-1}}
\centering
    \begin{tabular}{aaa}
    \toprule
    \multicolumn{3}{l}{This table was created with \textit{dcolumn}}\\
    \midrule
        -111.00 & 55.40 &  6.50\\
        5555.10 & -0.00001 & 0.011\\
    \midrule
       1.73 & 8.88 & 4.20 \\
       -1.50 & -666.00 & -0.0005 \\
    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{This meaningless table has all decimal points nicely aligned.}
\end{table}
\footnotetext[1]{\url{https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn}}

\subsection{A colour-blind-friendly heatmap}
The net profits of the 5 biggest publicly traded companies in the United States. This visualization quickly makes very clear that Tesla has not been nearly as profitable as other, similarly big companies.

\begin{table}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.8]{heatmap.png}
        \caption{Net Profits for Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet and Tesla }
\end{table}

\subsection{Interesting graph}
The following graph uses 5 colours that are generally easy to distinguish for colour-blind people. It shows cumulative returns over the 1-year period from November 23\textsuperscript{rd} 2020 to November 22\textsuperscript{nd} 2021 of the 5 biggest US companies by market capitalization.
 \begin{figure}[H]
   \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{cumreturns.png}
    \caption{Cumulative stock returns of the 5 biggest US companies, since Nov 23\textsuperscript{rd} 2020}
\end{figure}

\section{Conclusion}
Here we cite some more papers to show that we can comfortably work with .bib files. One example is \cite{Black1973}. Other possibly interesting readings are \cite{pursiainen2020cultural} and \cite{barras2020skill}, which were both recently published in the \textit{Journal of Finance}.
